'''
Great! You've written a config_loader.py utility to cleanly and consistently load your configuration settings from the config.yaml file. This makes your codebase more modular, reusable, and scalable â€” especially important in GenAI/LLM applications.

Why You Wrote This Function
You created this utility function to:
Avoid duplicating code every time you need to load settings from config.yaml.
Standardize how configurations are loaded across multiple Python files/modules (e.g., data ingestion, chatbot setup, vector store initialization).
Make your code cleaner and more maintainable, especially in team or production settings.
Allow you to easily swap config files later by just changing config_path.
